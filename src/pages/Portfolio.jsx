             which has now disappeared. Streaming services has since killed the once beloved BLOCKBUSTER. Either
              way we wanted to create a fun interactive site which allows users to be able to research various 
              movies, then can create a watch list and top favorite list. Not to mention how many books were
               written and then made into movie, how great would it be to search for that book too! If you donâ€™t
                have wifi the book for the win! As a group of developers we decided to go with technologies like
                 React.js and React-Bootstrap for front end design and UI, and for the backend we used
                  technologies like Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB Atlas and MongoDB Compass, Apollo GraphQL,
                   bcrypt, and more."
